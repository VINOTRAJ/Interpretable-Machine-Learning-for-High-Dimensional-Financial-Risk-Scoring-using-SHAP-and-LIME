Top 5 global drivers (SHAP ranking):
1. free_cash_flow_ratio  (mean|SHAP|=0.4252)
2. return_on_equity  (mean|SHAP|=0.4060)
3. quick_ratio  (mean|SHAP|=0.3815)
4. interest_coverage_ratio  (mean|SHAP|=0.3753)
5. cash_ratio  (mean|SHAP|=0.3735)

Directional interpretation (expected):
- free_cash_flow_ratio: ambiguous/depends
- return_on_equity: ambiguous/depends
- quick_ratio: ambiguous/depends
- interest_coverage_ratio: decreases default risk
- cash_ratio: ambiguous/depends

Strategic recommendations:
1. Auto-flag top-decile accounts by predicted probability for manual underwriting and request the top 3 SHAP drivers for each flagged account.
2. For accounts where cash-flow metrics drive risk, request near-term cash flow projections and covenant updates.
3. Investigate cases where SHAP and LIME disagree — these are potential blind spots or data issues requiring manual review.
4. Save SHAP values per decision for auditability and regulatory traceability; retrain monthly or on data drift.
